# books

## What is this project?

> &ldquo;**Oh no!** I can't remember _anything_ from all the books I've read a few years ago!&rdquo;

- **Solution**: From now on, take notes when reading. Review them afterwards.

> &ldquo;But I know myself. I'm definitely gonna give up before a month.&rdquo;

- **Solution**: Take notes on a public github repo so I become embarassed if I don't read.

## How do I take notes?

No fancy note-taking skills matter if I don't **actually read and take notes**, so I'm just going for the method that is easiest to implement.

- Summarize each chapter of the book.
- Write down some of the interesting lines.
- Write for **me in the future** to read. Do not care about other people reading.
- I'll mix Korean and English while taking note of English books, because that's what I'm comfortable with.

After completing a book, I may write a **review**. I could refer to sites like [Goodreads](https://www.goodreads.com/) for other people's opinions.

I may give a **rating** too. I use my own rating scale, which is very simple:

- How good are the good parts? Give a positive score of `+0` ~ `+5`.
- How bad are the bad parts? Give a negative score of `-0` ~ `-5`.

For example, if a novel had some good writing but the ending completely ruined the entire book, then I might give something like a `+2 -5`.

## What books will I read?

Checked ones are currently being read.

- [x] The News: A User's Manual - Alain de Botton `reread`
- [x] Sapiens: A Brief History of Humankind - Yuval Harari `first read`
- [ ] Justice - Michael Sandel `reread`
- [ ] GÃ¶del, Escher, Bach: an Eternal Golden Braid - Douglas Hofstadter `reread`

I may not read them in the order they are listed, and all plans are prone to change.
